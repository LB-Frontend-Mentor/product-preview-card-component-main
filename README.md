# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component

![Design preview for the Product preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I decided to dust off my CSS chops and made a point to increase my lighthouse scores by as much as possible.

I implemented preloaded images, inline @font-face declarations and minimised the impact of cumulative shift with pre-defined div aspect ratios to match the images filling them.

I'm not so bothered about getting the image to exactly match, rather I want to use this opportunity to create a semantically meaningful and accessible component that I will later be able to reuse in a React app context.

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements
